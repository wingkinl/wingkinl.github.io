Since Twitter changed its name to X, I can no longer tap on twitter.com links in my iPhone to open them in the native twitter/X app, but instead it just launches the default browser and opens the link. This is really annoying. I have tried restarting my iPhone several times, and even uninstalled and reinstalled X, but all to no avail. Until I found this post:

[Why in the heck can’t I get twitter links in discord or texts to open in the twitter app instead of browser? : r/ios (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/tssc0t/why_in_the_heck_cant_i_get_twitter_links_in/)

And here's the quote:

> If it also happens in texts and not just in-app web browsers then do the following steps.

> 1. Copy the full Twitter link into notepad

> 2. save the note

> 3. then in the note, long press on the link. You’ll see multiple options.

> 4. select open in twitter.

> That should force all Twitter links to open the app from anywhere. Note that many apps force you to use their in app browser and unless there is a setting to disable that, nothing you can do.

This simple trick solves the problem!
